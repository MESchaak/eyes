# Eyes

Exercise on eye movement coding. This exercise involved using JavaScript to allow for movement of the eye when moving the mouse over the eyes. The onmousemove event triggers the eye to follow the mouse. To run this exercise go to https://meschaak.github.io/eyes/ and hover your mouse of the pair of eyes on the screen.
